    <h1>Monarch Butterflies</h1>
    <p>Monach Butterflies are known for their long miragtion patterns. These butterlies travel thousands of miles from the United States and other coutries to Mexico and California. Due to the long journey that these butterflies make, a whole new generation of butterflies are the ones that make the trip back. Monarch butterflies have a distinct orange and black pattern on their wings that tell them apart from other types of butterlies. These colors and patterns also serve as a defense mechanism against predators to make them look poisonous. Monarch butterflies store toxins from their only food source, milkweed. These butterflies only eat milkweed and need it to lay their eggs. These butterflies are a vital part of the ecosystem and have so many things that set them apart from other butterflies and insects.</p>

    <h2>Unique Habits</h2>
    <p>Along with monarch butterflies long migration and milkweed dependence, their are a few more unique characteristics and habits that make these insects stand out. Butterflies got through a life cycle called metamorphosis. For a butterfly, this means they start off as an egg, become a caterpillar, form a chrysalis, then amerge from it as a beautiful butterfly. Monarch butterflies have a longer lifespan than other types of butterflies due to migration. Butterflies that do not migrate have a shorter lifespan than those that do migrate. Monarch butterflies belong to a family of butterflies called "brush-footed" because of their small and hair forelegs. Also, adult monarch are pollinators. They feed on nector from many different flowers during their migration and breeding perios.</p>
