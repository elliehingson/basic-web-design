            <h1>Monarch Butterfly Decline</h1>
            <p>Despite their resilience, monarch populations have been declining in recent years. Several factors have contributed to this decrease, including habitat loss, climate change, and the loss of milkweed due to agricultural practices. Milkweed is the primary food source for monarch larvae, and without it, monarchs cannot complete their life cycle. The deforestation of their wintering grounds in Mexico also plays a significant role. Conservationists and scientists are actively working to protect these critical habitats and ensure the monarch's future survival.</p>

            <h2>Threats to Monarchs</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Habitat Destruction: Urbanization and the conversion of land for agriculture have drastically reduced the habitats where monarchs can lay their eggs and find nectar.</li>
                <li>Pesticide Use: The widespread use of herbicides and pesticides harms monarch larvae and the plants they rely on.</li>
                <li>Climate Change: Extreme weather events and changing temperatures affect the monarchs’ migration patterns and the availability of food sources.</li>
                <li>Deforestation: The illegal logging in Mexico threatens the overwintering sites that monarchs depend on.</li> 
            </ul>
            <h3>How You Can Help</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Plant Milkweed: Planting milkweed in your garden or local area is one of the most effective ways to support monarchs. These plants provide food for the caterpillars and a place for the butterflies to lay their eggs.</li>
                <li>Create a Butterfly-Friendly Garden: Incorporate nectar-rich plants like butterfly bush, coneflowers, and asters to attract adult Monarchs.</li>
                <li>Support Conservation Organizations: Donate or volunteer with organizations focused on Monarch conservation, such as the Monarch Butterfly Fund or the Xerces Society.</li>
                <li>Spread Awareness: Educate others about the importance of Monarchs and the challenges they face. Encourage friends and family to take part in conservation efforts.</li>
            </ul>
